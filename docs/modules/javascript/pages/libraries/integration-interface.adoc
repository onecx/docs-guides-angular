[#overview]
== Overview
`@onecx/integration-interface` library is a set of tools written in **Typescript** that enables communication between Microfrontends. The library can be used in any desired technology.

NOTE: For Angular-based applications, the xref:angular:libraries/angular-integration-interface.adoc[@onecx/angular-integration-interface] library is available. It is a set of tools aiming to ease the development of Angular applications integrated with OneCX. For more information, please refer xref:angular:libraries/angular-integration-interface.adoc[here].

Shell uses AuthService from the `@onecx/angular-auth` library for authentication. During Shell initialization (via APP_INITIALIZER), AuthService is initialized. On successful initialization, the message is published to the Topic.
Data::
**Empty**

include::partial$app-state-service-note.adoc[]

[#message-topic]
=== Message Topic
Usage::
Write **messages to be displayed in an overlay on the top of the page**. Useful when it is desired to inform about a certain event happening via a message displayed for a short period of time. Publish a new message to display it.
Shell actions::
Shell will listen to messages published via this Topic and will display the message in a designated place.
Data::
**Message object** describing message to be displayed with the following structure:

NOTE: **Message object** structure is based on the https://primeng.org/toast[PrimeNG Toast API], which is used internally to display messages.

[#permissions-rpc-topic]
=== Permissions Rpc Topic
Usage::
Read the **user's permissions related to any Application**. Useful when it is desired to check if permission not related to the the current Microfrontend is met for current User (e.g., used for Remote Components). This topic should be used in a request-response fashion. Request messages should have the `permissions` property undefined and should be made by the Microfrontend containing Applications. Response messages will have the `permissions` property defined (`Array<string>`) and should be made by the Shell Application.
Shell actions::
Shell is listening to new messages published in the Topic. Whenever a message with the `permissions` property set to `undefined` is read by the Shell, it fetches permissions for the current user related to the requested Application.
Data::
**PermissionsRpc object** includes requested Application information and permissions with the following structure:
