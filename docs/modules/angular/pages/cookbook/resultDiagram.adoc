= Configure the result diagram
By default, a diagram is created which counts the different values in a column and shows the results. To use this diagram, the column which should be displayed needs to be selected first. The member 'columnId' holds the column id of the column.

== Please select the column to be displayed

_Adapt in File:_ `+<feature>-search.component.html+`

Adapt as required
`+columnId+` is the key for the diagram which shows the distribution of data of the selected column

[source, javascript]
----
    // Please select the column to be displayed
    columnId = 'id';
    column = this.columns.find((e) => e.id === this.columnId);        
----

== Adjust the position of the result diagram

If you want to change the position of the result diagram, you can change the layout of the ocx-content-container.

_Adapt in File:_ `+<feature>-search.component.html+`

.vertical layout
[source, html]
----
    <ocx-content-container layout="vertical">
----

.horizontal layout
[source, html]
----
    <ocx-content-container layout="horizontal">
